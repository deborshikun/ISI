Requirements:
1. PilotNet simultaion --> use trained model from shrishendu da's code, and for any dashcam given video, find the angles for each frame (pilotnet)
2. z3 solver --> given an onnx file, you will find the equations relating to the nodes of the said onnx, and you will feed these equations to z3-solver and for a given constraint, find SAT or UNSAT
3. use AcasXu onnx and its given constraints for z3,**  


Optional:
1. Use toy example sdnn to form an onnx file ourselves. Used to test out equations for z3 solver.
2. Ask Sir about how to use z3-solver, and how to fit the constraints for z3.		


Done:
1. SDNN mnist code.
2. Toy eg, PilotNet Hardcoded Matrices code.
3. Toy eg, z3 solver running.
4. onnx file reading, conversion to equations.
5. equations to z3 readable equations.


Papers to be read:
1. LCTES paper done.
2. nnv book done.
3. CSP slides done.
4.
